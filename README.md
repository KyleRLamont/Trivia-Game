## Basic instructions
In this game, you will be given the option to start the game by clicking the Start Game! button. Once clicked, the game will begin. It is a game of 10 multiple choice questions. You will be presented with each question one at a time. You will have 30 seconds to answer each question. Once the timer reaches 0, or you've selected your answer, the game will show you if you were right or wrong and advance to the next question. 

Once all of the questions have been shown, it will advance you to the result screen showing how many you got right, wrong, or did not answer. It will then also give you the option to restart the game.
